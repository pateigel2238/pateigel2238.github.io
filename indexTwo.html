<h1>Chapter Two Homework:</h1>
<p>&emsp; Chapter two of the pragmatic programmer was definitely a more in depth look at the happenings that exist in computer design. This section presented
<br>various different approaches on hw to structure work so that way designing a prgraam can be made as efficiently as possible. I thought that the most
<br>interesting section was the section on orthogonality. I picked this section because it seems ery applicable to programming efficiently (especially
<br>in a group). I would have to agree with the authors examination of this process in that making software that adheres to this principle will allow the
<br>development process to go much more smoothly.
<br>
<br>
&emsp; I think that this concept is interesting because the types of issues that are decribed in this section have happened to me. For example, the author
<br>talks about the benefits that orthogonalized spftware has in regard to group work. Being able to freely (or at least not as constrained) edit parts
<br>of a project without having to get together with your team and have a metting on the changes everyone is planning on making makes development less
<br>stressful and much quicker. Another benefit of orthogonality is that testing is much easier and more localzed. It is easier to solve problems within
<br>your software if you can check if things are working on a smaller level. So being able to test one section of code to see if that is working and not
<br>having to modify different parts of code to do so also results in less stress and makes things quicker. The last thing I will say about this section is
<br>that it helps out a lot with the removal of code. I often find out halfway done with a project that a certain function could be done way easier, or at
<br>least in a different way that makes my code run smoother. Then I end up having to deal with the afteraffects of deleting that section. This ultimately
<br>results in a tedious process that can be resolved if my code is managed in accordance with the principle of orthogonality.
