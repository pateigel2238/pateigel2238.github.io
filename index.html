<p>Homework for Tuesday:
 <br>    &emsp; I very much enjoyed reading about the second and third sections of chapter one. In these sections I thought that the anlogies well correlated with
 <br>what the author was trying to get across. The first was about <i>broken windows</i>. I thought this was very applicable and it is not hard to believe that
 <br>this a common problem. Right when you disregard one issue and tell yourself that you'll get back to it is where it starts. Then what I feel tends to
 <br>happen is you move on to another section of the code, work on that, and then run in to the same type of thing: "Oh that's a small thing I'll fix it
 <br>later" then these problems pile up. I think that I find this interesting because it is something that I tend to do in general. I tell myself that I
 <br>can just fix that thing later then end up not getting back to it for a while and have a bunch of other things to deal with.
 <br>
 <br>
     &emsp; I also enjoyed reading about the <b>Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs</b> analogy. I like this section because it seems very relavant to the fact that a project
 <br>only gets attention if the 'starting material' and furthermore the idea behind the project is a good one. Starting with a good idea and creating the
 <br>basic components is what attracts attention, and more attention brings more demand, and more demand means that more people are going to be interested
 <br>in getting involved. This of course brings resources and the ablity to make your project grow into what you really want it to be. I think this goes
 <br>hand in hand with the painting section. Don't try to add to much so that what you really want to do gets covered up by less important things. Let the
 <br>project evolve naturally and in a way that will make public interest gradually increase.
